# Structured reading content for Ottoman Empire Level 2: Expansion into Europe and the Fall of Constantinople

### I. Renewed Expansion and the Siege of Constantinople

By the mid-15th century, the Ottomans were poised for greatness. Under **Sultan Mehmed II**, also known as **Mehmed the Conqueror**, they resumed their push into Europe and set their sights on the ultimate prize: **Constantinople**, capital of the **Byzantine Empire**.

In **1453**, after a carefully planned siege, the Ottomans used **gunpowder artillery**, including the massive **Orban’s Cannon**, to breach the **Theodosian Walls**. Byzantine Emperor **Constantine XI** died defending the city, and on May 29, Constantinople fell. The Ottomans renamed it **Istanbul**, making it the empire’s new capital.

### II. A New Imperial Vision

After the conquest, Mehmed II declared himself **“Emperor of Rome”**, linking the Ottoman state to Roman imperial heritage. Rather than destroy the city, he rebuilt it. He transformed the **Hagia Sophia** into a mosque and encouraged **Jews, Christians, and Muslims** to repopulate the city.

He established the **millet system**, allowing religious communities to govern their own legal and social affairs. This pragmatic approach fostered stability and diversity.

### III. European Ambitions and Resistance

Mehmed launched further campaigns into the **Balkans**, conquering **Serbia**, **Bosnia**, and parts of **Hungary**. The Ottomans clashed with local Christian powers and faced fierce resistance from leaders like **Skanderbeg**, the Albanian national hero.

Despite some setbacks, the Ottomans established control over **Rumelia** (the European part of the empire) and pushed toward **Central Europe**.

### IV. Institutions and Governance

To manage his growing empire, Mehmed II created new legal codes called **Kanunname**, which blended **Islamic law (sharia)** with imperial decrees. He also founded the **Enderun School** inside the palace, which trained future administrators and viziers—many of whom came through the **devshirme** system.

Istanbul became a center of trade and governance. Its location on the **Silk Road** allowed the Ottomans to control routes between **Europe and Asia**, increasing their wealth and global significance.

### V. Reaction in Europe

The fall of Constantinople stunned Christian Europe, symbolizing the final collapse of the **Roman Empire**. The Ottomans were now seen as a major threat. Though several **crusades** were proposed, they largely failed to halt Ottoman progress.

Mehmed’s policies, military victories, and cultural innovations transformed the empire into a superpower with **imperial ambition**, **religious pluralism**, and a drive toward **bureaucratic efficiency**.
