### II. Military Power and Territorial Expansion

Suleiman led campaigns in **Europe**, **North Africa**, and the **Middle East**. He conquered **Belgrade** (1521), **Rhodes** (1522), and parts of **Hungary**, defeating the Hungarian army at **Mohács** in **1526**.

In **1529**, he famously laid siege to **Vienna**, though he failed to capture the city. In the east, he battled the **Safavid Empire**, gaining **Mesopotamia** and securing dominance over the Islamic world.

His navy, led by **Barbarossa**, challenged Spanish and Venetian fleets in the **Mediterranean**, establishing Ottoman maritime supremacy.

### III. Administration and Legal Reform

Suleiman codified **Islamic and secular law** through the **Kanunname**, which streamlined taxation, land ownership, and criminal law. This earned him the title **“Lawgiver”** within the empire.

He strengthened the **millet system**, allowing religious minorities to govern themselves under their own laws while remaining loyal to the sultan.

### IV. Cultural and Artistic Brilliance

The classical Ottoman style matured under Suleiman. His chief architect, **Mimar Sinan**, designed mosques, bridges, and palaces—including the majestic **Suleymaniye Mosque** in Istanbul.

The arts flourished: **miniature painting**, **calligraphy**, and **poetry** reached new heights. Suleiman himself was a skilled poet, writing under the pen name **“Muhibbi.”**

### V. The Imperial Court and Influential Figures

Suleiman’s court included powerful individuals like his **Grand Vizier, Ibrahim Pasha**, and his legal advisor, **Ebusuud Efendi**. But the most influential figure was his wife, **Hurrem Sultan** (Roxelana), a former concubine who became his legal wife—unusual for an Ottoman ruler.

Hurrem wielded significant political influence, founding charitable institutions and advising Suleiman. Her son, **Selim II**, eventually succeeded to the throne.

### VI. Legacy and Death
