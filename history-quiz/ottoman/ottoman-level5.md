# Structured reading content for Ottoman Empire Level 5: The Empire in Crisis and Collapse

### I. The 19th Century and the Tanzimat Reforms

By the early 1800s, the **Ottoman Empire** faced serious threats: military defeats, nationalist uprisings, and internal decay. Reformers believed modernization was the only path forward.

In **1839**, the **Tanzimat** (meaning “reorganization”) reforms began with the **Hatt-i Sharif of Gülhane**. The goal was to centralize authority, modernize the **army**, and grant **legal equality** to all subjects—Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

**Sultan Mahmud II** had earlier abolished the outdated **Janissary corps** in **1826**, replacing them with the **Nizam-i Cedid**, a modern army trained on European models.

### II. Reform and Resistance

Tanzimat reforms continued under **Sultans Abdulmecid** and **Abdulaziz**. They improved education, built railways, introduced a postal service, and laid the groundwork for a **constitutional monarchy**.

Yet many conservatives opposed these changes. Reformers clashed with traditionalists, while ethnic minorities began pushing for **independence**. In **1876**, Sultan **Abdulhamid II** introduced the **first Ottoman constitution**, but suspended it two years later, ruling autocratically for decades.

### III. Nationalism and Foreign Pressure

Inspired by the **French Revolution**, **nationalist movements** swept the empire. **Greece** won independence in **1830**, followed by **Serbia**, **Romania**, and **Bulgaria**. Meanwhile, **Muhammad Ali Pasha** in **Egypt** effectively ruled as an autonomous governor.

European powers, especially **Russia**, **Austria**, and **Britain**, interfered more frequently, using trade, diplomacy, and war to carve influence.

The **Crimean War** (1853–1856), in which the Ottomans allied with Britain and France against Russia, was a costly victory that failed to stop long-term decline.

### IV. The Young Turks and Constitutionalism

By the late 19th century, new groups like the **Young Turks** demanded a return to constitutional rule and more aggressive reforms. In **1908**, they forced Abdulhamid II to restore the **constitution**, leading to a brief period of modernization.

However, ethnic tensions, Balkan revolts, and political fragmentation continued. **Pan-Turkism** emerged as a dominant ideology, promoting Turkish identity over Ottoman pluralism.

### V. World War I and the End of Empire

The Ottomans entered **World War I** in **1914** on the side of the **Central Powers**. Their military suffered huge losses. The **Gallipoli Campaign** (1915) saw heroic defense by **Mustafa Kemal**, but the war exposed internal divisions.

During the war, the empire carried out the **Armenian Genocide**, deporting and killing over a million Armenians.

In **1918**, the empire surrendered. The **Treaty of Sèvres** (1920) dismantled Ottoman territories, leaving only Anatolia under Turkish control. Nationalist outrage grew.

### VI. Collapse and the Rise of Modern Turkey

Led by **Mustafa Kemal Atatürk**, Turkish nationalists rejected the Sèvres treaty and launched the **Turkish War of Independence**. By **1923**, they founded the **Republic of Turkey**, with **Ankara** as its capital.

The Ottoman **sultanate** was abolished, and in 1924, the **caliphate** was formally ended. After more than **600 years**, the Ottoman Empire was gone—replaced by a secular, nationalist republic.
