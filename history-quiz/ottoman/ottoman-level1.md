# Structured reading content for Ottoman Empire Level 1: Rise of the Ottomans

### I. The Birth of the Ottoman State

The **Ottoman Empire** began as a small Turkish principality in **Anatolia** at the turn of the 14th century. Founded by **Osman I** around **1299**, the state was one of many frontier **beyliks** that emerged as the **Seljuk Sultanate of Rum** collapsed.

Osman’s followers were known as **ghazis**—Muslim warriors committed to fighting non-Muslims and expanding Islam. Their success came not just from zeal, but from their skill in forming alliances and seizing opportunities during a time of regional chaos.

### II. Expansion and the Rise of Bursa

Osman’s son, **Orhan**, expanded the Ottoman territories and captured **Bursa** in **1326**, making it the first capital. With Bursa came increased wealth and prestige.

Orhan introduced new institutions, including a **standing army** of slave soldiers—the **Janissaries**—trained from captured or recruited Christian boys. This system evolved into the **devshirme**, a key part of Ottoman governance and military power.

### III. Military Power and the Role of the Sultan

The Ottomans adopted the title **“Sultan”** to emphasize both political and religious authority. Their early conquests targeted **Byzantine lands**, especially in western Anatolia and the Balkans.

The **Battle of Kosovo (1389)** marked a major victory, opening the Balkans to further expansion. The Ottomans developed elite military units: the **Janissaries** (infantry) and **Sipahis** (cavalry).

The guiding spirit of the early empire was a blend of **Islam**, **Sufism**, and **Turkic tribal loyalty**. The Ottoman state was pragmatic and inclusive, incorporating **Albanians**, **Serbs**, and other Balkan peoples into its armies and administration.

### IV. Crisis and Recovery

Under **Bayezid I**, the Ottomans faced their first major challenge. In **1402**, the Central Asian conqueror **Timur (Tamerlane)** defeated Bayezid at the **Battle of Ankara**, capturing him and plunging the empire into a **civil war** known as the **Ottoman Interregnum**.

Order was restored by **Mehmed I**, who reestablished the empire’s unity and institutions. His successor, **Murad II**, resumed Balkan campaigns and rebuilt Ottoman strength.

### V. Governance, Faith, and Culture

The Ottomans ruled through a flexible combination of **Islamic law (sharia)** and **customary law (kanun)**. Non-Muslims were allowed to practice their religions in exchange for paying the **jizya** tax.

Architecturally, the Ottomans were influenced by **Seljuk-Islamic** traditions, favoring domes, minarets, and geometric decoration. Their early cities, like Bursa and Edirne, became centers of Islamic scholarship and art.

### VI. Legacy of the Early Empire

By the mid-15th century, the Ottomans had created a strong, centralized state that combined **military excellence**, **religious legitimacy**, and **administrative innovation**. These foundations would allow the Ottomans to capture **Constantinople** in 1453 and become a world power.

But the roots of that empire lay in the **ghazi warriors**, **Sufi mystics**, and adaptable policies of the early Ottoman rulers.
