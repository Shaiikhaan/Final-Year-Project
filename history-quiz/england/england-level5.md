### I. The Hanoverians and Industrial Transformation (1714–1837)

With the death of Queen Anne in 1714, the crown passed to **George I** of Hanover — a Protestant German prince unfamiliar with English politics and language. His limited role marked a turning point: political power increasingly shifted to Parliament and the newly emerging office of **Prime Minister**.

Throughout the 18th century, Britain expanded its empire and underwent profound change. The **Industrial Revolution**, beginning around 1750, transformed the economy. Coal and iron powered machines, factories replaced cottage industries, and cities like **Manchester** and **Birmingham** exploded in size. Inventors like **James Watt** improved the steam engine, revolutionizing transport and production.

Social problems grew too: child labor, slums, and long working hours led to unrest. Yet reform movements slowly began to rise.

### II. The British Empire and Global Influence (1750–1901)

Britain’s global power expanded through **colonialism** and war. Victories in conflicts like the **Seven Years’ War** and **Napoleonic Wars** established British naval dominance. In 1801, the **Act of Union** created the **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland**.

**Queen Victoria** ruled from 1837 to 1901, overseeing the height of the **British Empire**. The Victorians saw themselves as a civilizing force, though this often masked exploitation. By 1900, Britain controlled vast territories across Africa, India, the Caribbean, and beyond.

Domestically, reforms like the **1832 Reform Act**, **abolition of slavery**, and **child labor laws** reshaped society. The **Great Exhibition** of 1851 celebrated industrial and imperial pride.

### III. War, Suffrage, and Struggle (1901–1945)

The 20th century began with confidence but quickly turned to crisis. **World War I (1914–1918)** saw millions dead and a generation scarred. In its wake, Britain granted **women over 30 the vote** in 1918 and full suffrage by 1928.

The **interwar years** were marked by economic depression, strikes, and the rise of fascism abroad. In **World War II**, Britain again stood firm, with **Winston Churchill** leading resistance against Nazi Germany.

The war ended in victory but left Britain weakened and in debt.

### IV. Post-War Britain and Decolonization (1945–1997)

After WWII, Britain built a **welfare state**, including the creation of the **National Health Service (NHS)** in 1948. But the empire was fading. India gained independence in 1947, followed by many other former colonies.

The post-war decades brought both growth and hardship. Immigration from the Caribbean, South Asia, and Africa reshaped British society, while economic crises and strikes dominated the 1970s.

**Margaret Thatcher**, Prime Minister from 1979–1990, ushered in free-market reforms and privatization. Her policies were divisive, but transformative.

### V. Modern Britain and the 21st Century (1997–Present)

**Tony Blair’s** government introduced minimum wage laws and supported U.S. action in Iraq — a controversial move. In 2012, Britain hosted the Olympics, showcasing its multicultural identity.

The 2016 **Brexit referendum** shocked the world as Britain voted to leave the **European Union**. In 2020, the **COVID-19 pandemic** hit, testing the health system and economy.

Modern Britain is shaped by debates over immigration, identity, and its place in the world. Though no longer an empire, it remains a cultural and political force.
