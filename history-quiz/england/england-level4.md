### I. The Early Stuarts and Religious Tensions (1603–1640)

The Tudor dynasty ended in 1603 with the death of **Elizabeth I**, who left no heir. The throne passed to her cousin **James VI of Scotland**, who became **James I of England**, uniting the crowns of England and Scotland under the **Stuart dynasty**. James believed strongly in the **divine right of kings**, clashing with Parliament over money and authority.

During his reign, the **King James Bible** was published — a literary masterpiece and religious milestone. But tensions simmered. Religious groups like **Puritans** pushed for more reform, while Catholics remained marginalized. In 1605, the **Gunpowder Plot**, led by **Guy Fawkes**, tried to blow up Parliament. It failed, but fear of Catholic conspiracies remained.

### II. Charles I and the English Civil War (1640–1649)

James’s son, **Charles I**, inherited the throne in 1625 and ruled with even greater disregard for Parliament. He dissolved it multiple times, raised taxes without consent, and tried to impose religious changes that many viewed as too Catholic.

Tensions exploded in 1642 when Charles attempted to arrest five MPs. Civil war broke out between **Royalists** (supporters of the king) and **Parliamentarians** (led by **Oliver Cromwell**). After years of brutal fighting, Charles was captured, tried for treason, and **executed in 1649** — the first English monarch to be publicly beheaded.

England was declared a **Commonwealth**, with no king. It was the end of monarchy — at least for a while.

### III. The Interregnum and Cromwell’s Rule (1649–1660)

After Charles I’s death, England became a republic led by **Oliver Cromwell**, who took the title **Lord Protector**. Though he promised liberty, his rule was strict and Puritan. He banned public celebrations like Christmas, closed theatres, and ruled through military might.

While Cromwell defeated threats at home and abroad, his regime lacked broad support. After his death in 1658, his son proved ineffective, and many longed for a return to monarchy.

In 1660, the monarchy was **restored** under **Charles II**, son of the executed king.

### IV. The Restoration and the Glorious Revolution (1660–1688)

Charles II ruled with flair and caution. Nicknamed the **Merry Monarch**, he reopened theatres and celebrated court life. However, religious and political tensions remained. Charles had no legitimate heirs, and his brother and successor, **James II**, was a Catholic — a deeply unpopular fact in Protestant England.

In 1688, James II was overthrown in the **Glorious Revolution**. Parliament invited his Protestant daughter **Mary** and her Dutch husband **William of Orange** to take the throne. James fled to France without a fight.

This peaceful coup cemented Parliament’s supremacy. The new monarchs agreed to the **Bill of Rights (1689)**, which limited royal power, banned Catholic monarchs, and laid the foundation for Britain’s **constitutional monarchy**.

### V. The Act of Union and Hanoverian Transition (1701–1714)

In the early 1700s, Queen **Anne** ruled a more stable Britain. Under her, the **Act of Union (1707)** united England and Scotland into the single kingdom of **Great Britain**. This period also saw the rise of early political parties: the **Whigs** and **Tories**.

When Anne died childless in 1714, Parliament bypassed many Catholic claimants and invited **George I** of **Hanover**, a distant Protestant relative, to become king. He barely spoke English and left much governing to ministers, marking the rise of the **Prime Minister** and a shift toward modern parliamentary rule.
