### I. The Norman Conquest and William I (1066–1087)

In 1066, **William, Duke of Normandy**, defeated Harold Godwinson at the **Battle of Hastings**, forever changing English history. William claimed the English throne, becoming **William the Conqueror**. To secure his rule, he built castles across the country, replacing Anglo-Saxon nobles with Norman lords. The **feudal system** was introduced, tying land to loyalty and military service.

To manage his new kingdom, William ordered a vast survey of land and property. Completed in 1086, the **Domesday Book** catalogued who owned what — and how much tax they owed. It remains one of the most famous administrative records in medieval Europe.

French became the language of the court, law, and aristocracy, while the common people continued speaking English. This linguistic blending laid the foundation for the modern English language.

### II. The Angevin Kings and Legal Reforms (1135–1216)

After a brief civil war known as **The Anarchy** (between Stephen and Empress Matilda), the crown passed to **Henry II**, founder of the **Plantagenet** dynasty. Henry expanded royal power and created what became **English common law**, establishing royal courts and traveling judges.

However, Henry’s rule was not without controversy. His quarrel with **Thomas Becket**, Archbishop of Canterbury, ended in Becket’s murder in 1170. This event shocked Christendom and eventually led to Becket’s sainthood.

Henry’s sons included **Richard the Lionheart**, famed for his role in the **Crusades**, and **King John**, infamous for losing Normandy and angering his barons. In **1215**, John was forced to sign the **Magna Carta**, a charter that limited royal power and laid groundwork for constitutional government.

### III. War, Plague, and Rebellion (1250–1400)

The 13th and 14th centuries saw turbulence and transformation. Under **Edward I**, England conquered Wales and waged wars in Scotland. Edward’s legal reforms strengthened Parliament’s role, although it remained mostly a tool of royal power.

The **Hundred Years’ War** (1337–1453) against France began during **Edward III’s** reign. English victories such as **Crécy** and **Agincourt** (under **Henry V**) made heroes of English kings. However, war was costly.

In 1348, the **Black Death** arrived. This devastating plague killed over a third of England’s population. With labor scarce, peasants demanded better conditions. Tensions led to the **Peasants’ Revolt** in **1381**, led by **Wat Tyler** — a rare but short-lived grassroots uprising.

### IV. The Wars of the Roses (1455–1485)

The 15th century was marked by civil war. The **Wars of the Roses** were fought between the noble **House of Lancaster** (red rose) and **House of York** (white rose), both claiming the throne.

Kings came and went. **Henry VI**, a weak and mentally unstable king, lost control to **Edward IV** of York. But Edward’s sudden death and the mysterious disappearance of his sons (the "Princes in the Tower") led to the brief reign of **Richard III**.

In **1485**, **Henry Tudor**, a distant Lancastrian claimant, defeated Richard III at the **Battle of Bosworth Field**, ending the Plantagenet dynasty. Henry became **Henry VII**, founding the **Tudor dynasty** — and ushering in a new age.
