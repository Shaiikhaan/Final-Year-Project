### I. The Rise of the Tudors (1485–1509)

The **Tudor dynasty** began with **Henry VII**, who took the throne after defeating **Richard III** at the **Battle of Bosworth Field** in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses. Henry VII strengthened the monarchy by restoring law and order, centralizing power, and marrying **Elizabeth of York** to unite the rival houses of Lancaster and York. A cautious ruler, he avoided wars and built England’s wealth through careful trade and taxation.

His reign set the stage for his son, **Henry VIII**, one of England’s most famous and controversial monarchs.

### II. Henry VIII and the English Reformation (1509–1547)

**Henry VIII** is remembered for his six wives and dramatic break from the **Catholic Church**. Initially a loyal Catholic, Henry sought a divorce from his first wife, **Catherine of Aragon**, when she failed to produce a male heir. The Pope refused to grant it, so Henry declared himself head of the **Church of England** in 1534.

His second wife, **Anne Boleyn**, gave birth to **Elizabeth**, but she, too, was eventually executed. His third wife, **Jane Seymour**, bore **Edward VI**, Henry’s only male heir. Henry’s later marriages — to **Anne of Cleves**, **Catherine Howard**, and **Catherine Parr** — ended in annulment, execution, and survival, respectively.

Henry closed monasteries, redistributed church land, and dramatically altered religious life. Yet England under Henry remained theologically conservative, even while severing ties with Rome.

### III. Edward VI and Mary I (1547–1558)

**Edward VI**, Henry’s sickly son, ruled for just six years. During his reign, England became more **Protestant**. Church services were held in English, not Latin, and the **Book of Common Prayer** was introduced.

Edward’s early death sparked a succession crisis. Protestant nobles placed **Lady Jane Grey** on the throne for just nine days before **Mary I**, daughter of Catherine of Aragon, claimed her right. A staunch Catholic, Mary reversed Protestant reforms and restored ties with the Pope. Her persecution of Protestants earned her the nickname **"Bloody Mary."** She married **Philip II of Spain**, a move that proved deeply unpopular.

### IV. The Reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603)

After Mary’s death, her half-sister **Elizabeth I** became queen. Her reign was marked by religious compromise, national pride, and cultural flourishing. Elizabeth reinstated the **Church of England** but avoided extreme policies, allowing moderate Catholics and Protestants to coexist under her **Elizabethan Religious Settlement**.

Her reign saw the defeat of the **Spanish Armada** in 1588, a defining moment of national pride. Though Elizabeth never married — earning her the title the **"Virgin Queen"** — her court was full of intrigue and suitors. Her rule was also the age of **William Shakespeare**, whose plays helped define the English language and national identity.

Elizabeth skillfully managed threats from abroad and internal rebellion. By her death in 1603, she had ruled for 45 years and left behind a more secure, prosperous, and confident England.
