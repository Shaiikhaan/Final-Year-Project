### I. The Mythical Founding of Rome (c. 753 BCE)

According to legend, **Romulus and Remus**, twin sons of the war god **Mars**, were abandoned and raised by a she-wolf. Romulus later killed Remus and founded **Rome** in 753 BCE. Though mythological, this origin story reflected Rome’s ideals of strength, conflict, and divine favor.

Early Rome was a monarchy, ruled by **Etruscan kings**, whose engineering, religious rituals, and symbols left lasting impressions on Roman culture.

### II. The Roman Republic (509 BCE – 27 BCE)

In 509 BCE, Romans overthrew their last king and established a **Republic**, ruled by elected officials and a powerful **Senate**. The Republic balanced aristocratic and popular elements through offices like **consuls**, **tribunes**, and **assemblies**.

Conflict between **patricians** (aristocrats) and **plebeians** (commoners) led to legal reforms like the **Twelve Tables**, Rome’s first written code of law. As citizenship expanded and military service became a civic duty, Rome’s influence began to spread across the Italian peninsula.

### III. Expansion and the Punic Wars (264 – 146 BCE)

Rome’s major rival was **Carthage**, a powerful North African city-state. The **Punic Wars**, especially the **Second Punic War**, were defining moments. The Carthaginian general **Hannibal** crossed the Alps and devastated Italy, but Roman resilience led to victory under **Scipio Africanus** at **Zama** in 202 BCE.

By 146 BCE, Rome had destroyed Carthage and emerged as the dominant Mediterranean power.

### IV. Crisis and Civil War (133 – 27 BCE)

Rapid expansion strained the Republic. Land inequality, slave revolts, and political violence grew. Reformers like the **Gracchi brothers** tried to redistribute land but were killed. Generals like **Marius** and **Sulla** began using their armies for political power.

Eventually, **Julius Caesar** defied the Senate, crossed the **Rubicon River** in 49 BCE, and seized control. He made sweeping reforms but was assassinated in **44 BCE** by senators hoping to restore the Republic.

### V. From Republic to Empire (27 BCE)

After Caesar’s death, his adopted heir **Octavian** defeated rivals **Mark Antony** and **Cleopatra** at the **Battle of Actium** in 31 BCE. In **27 BCE**, Octavian became **Augustus**, the first **emperor** of Rome.

This marked the beginning of the **Roman Empire**, an era of peace, prosperity, and monumental building known as the **Pax Romana**.

### VI. Legacy of Early Rome

Rome’s legacy shaped much of Europe and the Mediterranean. Roman **law**, **language** (**Latin**), **engineering** (roads, aqueducts), and the idea of **citizenship** became foundations of Western civilization. From its mythic founding to imperial greatness, early Rome defined Italy’s place in the ancient world.
