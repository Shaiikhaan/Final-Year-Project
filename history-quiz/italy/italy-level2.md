### I. The Collapse of the Western Roman Empire (476 CE)

In **476 CE**, the last Roman emperor in the West was deposed, marking the traditional end of the Western Roman Empire. Italy, once the heart of an empire, became a fragmented land ruled by various Germanic tribes, starting with the **Ostrogoths** under **Theodoric the Great**.

While chaos engulfed much of Europe, Italy retained remnants of Roman infrastructure, law, and culture. Yet it became a battleground for power between local warlords, invading empires, and later, the **Byzantines** and **Lombards**.

### II. Byzantines, Lombards, and the Papal States (6th–9th Century)

The **Byzantine Empire** (Eastern Roman Empire) reconquered parts of Italy under **Emperor Justinian**, but control was contested by the **Lombards**, a Germanic people who established a powerful kingdom in northern Italy.

To resist Lombard dominance, the **Popes** allied with the rising **Frankish kings**. In **800 CE**, **Charlemagne** was crowned **Holy Roman Emperor** by **Pope Leo III**, reinforcing the idea of a Christian Roman Empire centered in Western Europe. The **Papal States** emerged as a theocratic realm governed by the Pope.

### III. The Rise of City-States and Communes (10th–13th Century)

By the High Middle Ages, Italy had splintered into **independent city-states** like **Florence**, **Venice**, **Genoa**, **Milan**, and **Pisa**. Many began as **communes**—self-governing urban centers led by elected officials, merchants, and guilds.

These cities grew rich through **trade**, particularly with the **Byzantine** and **Islamic** worlds. Their wealth fueled competition, innovation, and the early seeds of the **Renaissance**.

### IV. Guelphs and Ghibellines: Political Factions

Medieval Italy was torn by rivalry between the **Guelphs** (supporters of the Pope) and **Ghibellines** (supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor). These factions divided cities and families, fueling conflict and shaping local identities.

Writers like **Dante Alighieri**, exiled from Florence due to political conflict, captured the turmoil of the time in literary works like *The Divine Comedy*.

### V. Universities and Cultural Growth

Despite political strife, Italian cities led Europe in education and legal scholarship. Universities like **Bologna** (founded 1088) became renowned for studies in **Roman law**, theology, and philosophy. Scholars preserved classical knowledge and debated new ideas, laying groundwork for the coming humanist revival.

### VI. Legacy of Medieval Italy

Though politically fragmented, medieval Italy was vibrant, diverse, and foundational to European development. The institutions of **communes**, the revival of **classical learning**, and the growing power of cities prepared Italy for the intellectual explosion of the Renaissance.
