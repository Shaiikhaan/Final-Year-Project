# Structured reading content for Italy Level 5: Fascism, Republic, and Modern Italy

### I. The Rise of Fascism (1919–1922)

After World War I, Italy was plagued by economic crisis, political instability, and disillusionment with the liberal government. In this climate, **Benito Mussolini**, a former socialist, founded the **Fascist Party** in **1919**.

In **1922**, Mussolini led the **March on Rome**, pressuring King **Victor Emmanuel III** to appoint him Prime Minister. Mussolini took the title **“Il Duce”** (the Leader) and established a one-party dictatorship, crushing dissent and promoting aggressive nationalism.

### II. Fascist Rule and World War II (1922–1945)

Mussolini’s regime aimed to restore Italy’s imperial glory. In **1935**, Italy invaded **Ethiopia**. The **Lateran Treaty of 1929** reconciled the state with the **Catholic Church**, creating **Vatican City** as an independent state.

Italy joined forces with **Nazi Germany**, forming the **Axis Powers**. During World War II, Italy faced military failures, domestic unrest, and Allied invasion. In **1943**, Mussolini was overthrown. He was later captured and **executed** in **1945**.

### III. Birth of the Republic (1946)

In **1946**, Italians voted in a **referendum** to abolish the monarchy. **King Umberto II**, the last monarch, went into exile. Italy became a **republic**, adopting a new constitution in 1948.

This marked a profound shift: Italy had gone from fascist dictatorship to a democratic republic in just a few years.

### IV. Postwar Recovery and the Economic Miracle

The late 1940s and 1950s saw rapid reconstruction and industrial growth. Italy experienced the **“economic miracle,”** transforming from a rural society to an industrial powerhouse.

In **1957**, Italy became a founding member of the **European Economic Community** (precursor to the EU), aligning itself with Western Europe and NATO.

### V. Social Unrest and Political Turmoil (1960s–1980s)

Despite prosperity, Italy faced significant unrest. The **Anni di Piombo** (“**Years of Lead**”) saw political extremism, bombings, and assassinations. In **1978**, former Prime Minister **Aldo Moro** was kidnapped and killed by the **Red Brigades**, a far-left terrorist group.

These decades also saw corruption and organized crime—especially the **Mafia**—undermining public trust in the government.

### VI. Modern Italy and Political Reform

The **1990s** brought the **Clean Hands (Mani Pulite)** investigation, exposing deep political corruption (**Tangentopoli**) and leading to the collapse of Italy’s postwar party system.

In this vacuum rose new figures, most notably **Silvio Berlusconi**, a billionaire media tycoon who served as Prime Minister several times beginning in the 1990s.

Italy adopted the **euro** in **2002**, continues to play a leading role in the **European Union**, and remains a **parliamentary republic** with **Rome** as its capital.

While modern Italy faces ongoing challenges—economic inequality, immigration, and organized crime—it stands as a resilient democracy rooted in centuries of transformation.
