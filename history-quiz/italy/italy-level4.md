# Structured reading content for Italy Level 4: Unification and the Birth of a Nation

### I. The Fragmented Italian Peninsula (1815)

After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, the **Congress of Vienna** restored old monarchies and divided Italy into multiple states. These included the **Kingdom of Sardinia**, **Kingdom of the Two Sicilies**, the **Papal States**, and Austrian-controlled **Lombardy-Venetia**.

This fragmentation stifled national unity and kept Italy under foreign domination or conservative rule, sparking discontent among revolutionaries and intellectuals.

### II. The Rise of Nationalism and Secret Societies

Throughout the 1820s–40s, secret nationalist groups like the **Carbonari** plotted against oppressive rulers. **Giuseppe Mazzini** founded **Young Italy**, calling for a united, republican Italy based on popular sovereignty.

Although early uprisings failed, they inspired growing support for unification across classes and regions. Mazzini’s vision of a **republic** inspired nationalists, though he never held power.

### III. Cavour and the Politics of Unification

The **Kingdom of Sardinia**, under **King Victor Emmanuel II** and his prime minister **Count Camillo di Cavour**, became the center of the unification movement. Cavour believed in **liberal nationalism** and pursued diplomacy and modernization.

Sardinia joined the **Crimean War** (1855) to gain international recognition. In 1859, after a secret agreement with **Napoleon III**, Sardinia provoked war with Austria and won key victories at the **Battle of Magenta** and the **Battle of Solferino**, gaining **Lombardy**.

### IV. Garibaldi and the Red Shirts

While Cavour worked diplomatically in the north, **Giuseppe Garibaldi** led a daring military campaign in the south. In 1860, he and his **Red Shirts** invaded and conquered the **Kingdom of the Two Sicilies**.

Despite being a committed **republican**, Garibaldi supported national unity and handed over control to **Victor Emmanuel II**. When they met, Garibaldi famously saluted him with the words, **“I obey.”**

In **1861**, the **Kingdom of Italy** was officially proclaimed, with **Turin** as its capital.

### V. Completing Unification: Venetia and Rome

Unification was not complete in 1861. The **Austrian Empire** still controlled **Venetia**, and **Rome** was protected by French troops. In 1866, Italy allied with **Prussia** in the **Austro-Prussian War** and was awarded Venetia.

Finally, in **1870**, **France withdrew its troops** from Rome to fight in the **Franco-Prussian War**. Italian troops entered the city, and Rome became the **capital of Italy**.

The **Pope**, who had ruled the **Papal States**, refused to recognize the new regime and called himself a **“prisoner in the Vatican.”** The church issued the policy of **Non Expedit**, advising Catholics to avoid participation in Italian politics.

### VI. Challenges of the New Kingdom

Unified Italy faced serious challenges. The **north-south divide** was pronounced, with the industrial north far more developed than the rural south. **Poverty**, **illiteracy**, and lack of infrastructure plagued the nation.

Italy was now a **constitutional monarchy**, but many Italians — especially in the south — felt disconnected from the political elite.

Still, the **Risorgimento** (Italian for “resurgence”) had succeeded in transforming Italy from a fragmented patchwork of states into a unified nation.
