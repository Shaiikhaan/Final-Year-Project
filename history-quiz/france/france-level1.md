### I. Prehistoric and Celtic Gaul (before 1st century BCE)

Before it was called France, the land was known to the Romans as **Gaul**. It was home to various **Celtic tribes**, often referred to as **Gauls**. These tribes had their own languages, warrior cultures, and religious traditions centered around nature and druidic practices.

One of the most famous Gallic leaders was **Vercingetorix**, who united the tribes to resist Roman invasion. In 52 BCE, he was defeated by **Julius Caesar** at the **Battle of Alesia**, marking the beginning of Roman rule.

### II. Roman Gaul (1st century BCE – 5th century CE)

Under Roman rule, Gaul became a key part of the Roman Empire. Roads, aqueducts, and amphitheaters were built, and cities like **Lutetia** (modern-day Paris) flourished. Latin became the dominant language, and Roman law, culture, and architecture left a lasting legacy.

Gaul also contributed to the Roman military and administration. Over time, many Gauls adopted Roman customs and religion, especially **Christianity**, which spread across the region during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE.

But Rome itself weakened, and by the 5th century, Gaul faced invasions from Germanic tribes — particularly the **Franks**, who would shape the future of France.

### III. The Rise of the Franks (5th – 8th centuries)

The **Franks** were a Germanic people who gradually took control of northern and central Gaul. Their most famous early king was **Clovis I**, who united many Frankish tribes and converted to **Christianity** around 500 CE — a moment that strengthened ties with the Roman Church and laid the foundations of medieval French identity.

Clovis established the **Merovingian dynasty**, which ruled for over 200 years. Frankish power slowly expanded, and the kingdom became a key player in early medieval Europe.

### IV. The Carolingians and Charlemagne (8th – 9th centuries)

By the 8th century, the Merovingian kings had become weak, and power shifted to a new dynasty: the **Carolingians**. In 768, **Charlemagne** (Charles the Great) became king. He expanded the Frankish Empire across much of Western Europe and was crowned **Emperor of the Romans** in 800 by the Pope.

Charlemagne promoted education, law, and Christianity. His rule marked a cultural revival sometimes called the **Carolingian Renaissance**. After his death, however, his empire was divided, leading to new kingdoms — one of which would become **France**.

### V. The Formation of France (9th – 10th centuries)

Following the **Treaty of Verdun** in 843, Charlemagne’s empire was split among his grandsons. The western portion, known as **West Francia**, eventually evolved into the medieval kingdom of France.

France faced internal struggles and external threats, including **Viking raids** along its rivers. Local lords gained power, and the monarchy became more symbolic than strong. However, in 987, **Hugh Capet** was elected king, founding the **Capetian dynasty**, which would rule France for centuries and slowly rebuild royal authority.

These early centuries set the stage for France’s rise as a powerful medieval kingdom.
