# France Level 5: Revolution to Republic

## The Fall of the Monarchy
In **1789**, deep economic crisis, social inequality, and Enlightenment ideas sparked the **French Revolution**. The storming of the **Bastille** became the revolutionâ€™s symbol. King **Louis XVI** tried to maintain control, but by 1791, a **constitutional monarchy** was formed. A year later, the monarchy collapsed entirely.

## Radical Phase and the Reign of Terror
The **National Convention** abolished the monarchy and declared a **Republic**. **Maximilien Robespierre** led the **Reign of Terror**, where thousands, including Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, were executed. The **guillotine** became the symbol of revolutionary justice.

## The Rise of Napoleon
After the Terror, France was governed by the **Directory**, a weak executive body. In **1799**, **Napoleon Bonaparte** seized power in a coup. He declared himself **emperor in 1804**, established the **Napoleonic Code**, and reformed the legal and education systems.

## Empire and Collapse
Napoleon conquered much of Europe but suffered defeats in **Russia** and finally at **Waterloo (1815)**. He was exiled, and the **Bourbon monarchy** was restored.

## Toward a Modern Republic
Though monarchy returned briefly, revolutionary ideals endured. France experimented with monarchy, empire, and republic until finally stabilizing as a **modern secular republic** by the late 19th century.
