### I. The Capetian Kings (987–1108)

In 987, **Hugh Capet** was elected King of France, beginning the **Capetian dynasty**. Initially, his control was limited mostly to the area around Paris. France at this time was a patchwork of feudal territories ruled by powerful nobles who often ignored the king's authority.

Over the next century, Capetian kings slowly increased their influence. Kings like **Robert II** and **Philip I** expanded royal control through strategic marriages, alliances, and military campaigns. However, it would take time before the monarchy grew strong enough to truly unify France.

### II. Feudalism and French Society

Medieval France operated under a system called **feudalism**. At the top was the king, followed by powerful nobles, vassals, knights, and peasants. In return for land and protection, vassals pledged loyalty and service to their lords. Most people were peasants who worked the land and had little freedom.

The **Catholic Church** was also a major power, owning large amounts of land and influencing every aspect of life. Bishops and abbots often had as much wealth and influence as nobles.

### III. The Crusades and France’s Role (1095–1204)

In 1095, **Pope Urban II** called on Christians to retake the **Holy Land** from Muslim control. This began the **First Crusade**, and many French nobles joined, including **Raymond of Toulouse** and **Godfrey of Bouillon**.

The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and established **Crusader States**. These wars had a huge impact: they strengthened ties between France and the Papacy, increased the prestige of the monarchy, and brought wealth and new ideas from the East.

The **Second Crusade** (1147–1149), led by **King Louis VII**, ended in failure. The **Third Crusade** (1189–1192) involved **Philip II Augustus** of France and **Richard the Lionheart** of England, though Philip left early after quarrels.

### IV. Philip II and the Rise of Royal Power (1180–1223)

**Philip II**, also called **Philip Augustus**, significantly increased the power of the French monarchy. He reorganized the government, strengthened the army, and expanded royal lands.

His most notable success came against **King John of England**, from whom he seized large territories in Normandy and western France. By the end of his reign, France was larger, more centralized, and better governed.

Philip also supported towns, trade, and a stronger legal system — all steps toward a modern state.

### V. Religion and the Cathars

Not all religious movements pleased the Church. In southern France, a group called the **Cathars** spread ideas the Church considered heretical. They rejected the Catholic clergy and preached a dualist religion.

In response, the Church launched the **Albigensian Crusade** (1209–1229), a brutal campaign to crush Catharism. Northern French nobles used the crusade as an excuse to extend their control into the south.

The result was greater royal and Church authority across more of France, though at a devastating cost.
