### I. The Capetian High Point and Crisis (13th – 14th centuries)

Under **Louis IX** (Saint Louis), France reached a high point of medieval power. He was known for justice, fairness, and piety, and led two crusades. His grandson, **Philip IV (Philip the Fair)**, strengthened the French state but clashed with the Papacy. He created the **Estates General**, a council of nobles, clergy, and commoners.

By the early 1300s, France was wealthy and centralized, but things began to unravel. Famine, political instability, and tensions with England set the stage for conflict.

### II. The Hundred Years’ War Begins (1337–1453)

The **Hundred Years’ War** was not one long battle, but a series of wars between **France and England**. It began in 1337 when **Edward III of England** claimed the French throne after the death of the French king with no direct male heir.

The early phase of the war went badly for France. At battles like **Crécy (1346)** and **Poitiers (1356)**, English longbowmen devastated French knights. In 1360, the **Treaty of Brétigny** temporarily halted the war, with large parts of France given to England.

### III. Crisis and Recovery

France was further weakened by the **Black Death** (1347–1351), which killed nearly a third of its population. The country suffered from internal rebellion, economic collapse, and weak kings. English forces occupied much of southwestern France.

But France slowly recovered. Under **Charles V** (the Wise), France regained territory and built a strong army. Yet conflict resumed in the 15th century, and the English again took the upper hand, even capturing **Paris**.

### IV. Joan of Arc and French Revival

In 1429, a young peasant girl named **Joan of Arc** claimed to have visions from God urging her to save France. She convinced **Charles VII** to let her lead an army to lift the siege of **Orléans**, which she did successfully.

Joan’s victories rallied French morale. She helped Charles VII be crowned at **Reims**, a powerful symbol of legitimacy. But in 1431, Joan was captured by the English, tried for heresy, and **burned at the stake**. She would later be declared a martyr and saint.

### V. The End of the War and France's Recovery

After Joan’s death, France gradually regained strength. Charles VII reformed the army and taxation system. By **1453**, the English were driven out of all major French territories except **Calais**.

The war had lasted over a century but left France more unified. The monarchy emerged stronger, and French national identity had taken root — in part thanks to Joan of Arc's legendary sacrifice.
