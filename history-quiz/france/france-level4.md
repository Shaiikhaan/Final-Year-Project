# France Level 4: Renaissance, Reformation & Wars of Religion

## The French Renaissance and Humanism
The early 16th century saw France blossom under **Francis I**, a monarch who embraced Renaissance values. He patronized art and letters, brought Italian thinkers to court, and supported the spread of **humanist education**. Leonardo da Vinci even spent his final years in France under his protection.

## The Rise of the Huguenots
With the Protestant Reformation spreading through Europe, France became deeply divided. Many nobles and middle-class townspeople embraced **Calvinism**, becoming known as **Huguenots**. However, the Catholic monarchy saw this as a threat to unity and royal authority.

## The Wars of Religion (1562–1598)
Religious violence erupted in 1562 between Catholics and Huguenots. For nearly four decades, France was torn apart by civil wars, political intrigue, and religious hatred. The most infamous moment came in **1572** with the **St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre**, when thousands of Protestants were slaughtered in Paris and other cities.

## The Bourbon Solution: Henry IV and the Edict of Nantes
The conflict ended when **Henry of Navarre**, a Protestant noble, became **Henry IV of France**. To gain acceptance, he converted to Catholicism, allegedly saying, *"Paris is worth a Mass."* In **1598**, he issued the **Edict of Nantes**, granting religious toleration and ending the wars.

Henry’s reign brought peace and began the **Bourbon dynasty**, which would rule France until the Revolution. His pragmatic policies laid the groundwork for strong monarchical authority in the 17th century.
