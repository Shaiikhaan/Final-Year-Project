### I. Japan’s Imperial Ambitions

By the early 20th century, Japan had emerged as a modern industrial power. Inspired by nationalism and **Pan-Asianism**, leaders sought to expand Japan’s influence across Asia. Victories in the **First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895)** and the **Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905)** shocked the world, proving Japan’s military might.

The **Treaty of Portsmouth** ended the Russo-Japanese War and granted Japan control of Korea and parts of Manchuria. Japan joined the **Triple Entente** in World War I and gained former **German Pacific islands**.

### II. From Democracy to Militarism

The **1920s** saw limited democratic reform, but crises like the **1923 Great Kanto Earthquake** and global depression eroded faith in civilian government. The military gained power, promoting expansion and national pride.

In **1931**, Japan invaded **Manchuria** and created the puppet state **Manchukuo**, defying international criticism. By the **Second Sino-Japanese War (1937)**, Japan sought full dominance in China, committing atrocities such as the **Nanjing Massacre**.

### III. Toward Global War

Under Emperor **Hirohito**, Japan promoted the **Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere**, claiming to liberate Asia from Western powers while expanding its empire.

In **1940**, Japan joined the **Axis Powers** with Germany and Italy. On **December 7, 1941**, Japan attacked **Pearl Harbor**, drawing the U.S. into **World War II**. Swift invasions followed across Southeast Asia.

### IV. The Pacific War

Japan dominated early WWII campaigns through **naval and aerial warfare**, but faced setbacks at **Midway (1942)** and **Guadalcanal**. As Allied forces closed in, Japan used **kamikaze** pilots—suicide attackers meant to damage enemy ships.

By 1945, Japan faced total defeat. On **August 6 and 9**, the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki**. Over 200,000 died.

On **September 2, 1945**, Japan surrendered aboard the **USS Missouri**, ending the war.

### V. Occupation and Reform

The U.S. led postwar reconstruction through **SCAP (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers)**, headed by General **Douglas MacArthur**. Japan adopted a new **constitution in 1947**, transforming into a **parliamentary democracy**.

**Article 9** of the constitution renounced war, limiting Japan to a self-defense force. Emperor Hirohito was retained as a **symbolic monarch**, no longer divine.

The U.S. helped rebuild Japan’s economy, laying the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous nation.
