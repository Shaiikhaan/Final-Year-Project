# Structured reading content for Japan Level 4: The Meiji Restoration and Modernization

### I. The Fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate

By the mid-19th century, the Tokugawa Shogunate had grown weak. Internal unrest, economic stagnation, and dissatisfaction with isolationist policies left Japan vulnerable. In **1853**, **Commodore Matthew Perry** of the United States arrived with a fleet, demanding trade access.

The **Treaty of Kanagawa** (1854) opened Japanese ports to American ships, ending over 200 years of seclusion. Other Western powers soon followed, signing unequal treaties. This sparked national outrage and debates over Japan’s future.

### II. The Meiji Restoration (1868)

In **1868**, reformist samurai from **Satsuma** and **Choshu** domains overthrew the Tokugawa and restored power to the **emperor**, a movement called the **Meiji Restoration**. The young Emperor **Meiji** (Mutsuhito) became the symbol of national unity.

The slogan **“Fukoku kyōhei”** (“Rich country, strong army”) captured the era’s goal: to modernize rapidly and defend against Western domination.

### III. Reforms and Modernization

Feudal domains were abolished and replaced by **prefectures** under central control. The **samurai class** was dismantled, and many former warriors lost their privileges and stipends.

The government issued the **Charter Oath of 1868**, committing to modernization and legal equality. A new **constitution** was adopted in **1889**, creating a **constitutional monarchy** and a legislature called the **Diet**.

Western experts were invited to advise on military, education, infrastructure, and law. The **German army** and **British navy** served as models. A national **conscription army** replaced samurai militias.

### IV. Economic and Educational Growth

Japan’s economy rapidly industrialized. The government built railways, shipyards, and factories. **Silk and textiles** became leading exports. Private companies called **zaibatsu** (e.g., Mitsubishi) rose to prominence.

A national **school system** emphasized literacy, science, and patriotism. Students learned from **Western textbooks**, but also about **Shinto**, emperor worship, and national pride.

### V. Resistance and Rebellion

Not everyone embraced change. In **1877**, the **Satsuma Rebellion** broke out, led by **Saigo Takamori**, a former samurai and Meiji reformer. The rebellion failed, but highlighted tensions between modernization and tradition.

Despite unrest, Japan remained committed to reform. **Shinto nationalism** and emperor worship helped forge a shared identity.

### VI. Japan on the World Stage

In **1894–1895**, Japan fought and won the **First Sino-Japanese War**, defeating China and gaining control of **Taiwan (Formosa)**. It was a major victory that shocked the world and proved Japan’s modern military strength.

By the early 20th century, Japan had transformed into a centralized, industrial, and imperial power—determined to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the West.
