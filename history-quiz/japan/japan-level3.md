# Structured reading content for Japan Level 3: Unification and Isolation

### I. Warring States and the Rise of Unifiers

During the **Sengoku period** (late 15th to late 16th century), Japan was torn by civil war as feudal lords (**daimyo**) vied for control. Into this chaos rose three powerful leaders who would unify the country.

First was **Oda Nobunaga**, who used firearms and bold tactics to crush rival clans and reduce Buddhist political power. His successor, **Toyotomi Hideyoshi**, completed much of the unification and launched invasions of Korea, though they ultimately failed. Finally, **Tokugawa Ieyasu** defeated rivals at the **Battle of Sekigahara** in **1600**, securing control of the nation.

### II. Tokugawa Rule and the Shogunate (1603–1868)

In **1603**, Tokugawa Ieyasu was named **shogun**, beginning over **250 years of Tokugawa rule**. The **Tokugawa Shogunate** ruled from **Edo** (now Tokyo), while the emperor remained a symbolic figure in Kyoto.

To control the powerful daimyo, the Tokugawa implemented the **sankin-kotai** system, requiring lords to alternate residence between their domains and Edo. This fostered loyalty and helped create a vast network of roads and infrastructure.

### III. Isolation and Foreign Policy

Fearful of foreign influence, particularly **Christianity** and European colonization, the Tokugawa imposed a strict policy of **sakoku**, or **closed country**. Foreign travel was banned, Christianity was outlawed, and foreign missionaries were expelled.

Only a limited number of Dutch and Chinese traders were allowed to operate in **Nagasaki**, Japan’s sole open port.

The **Shimabara Rebellion** (1637–38), a revolt of Christian peasants, was brutally suppressed and reinforced the shogunate’s hostility to Christianity.

### IV. Society and Hierarchy

Tokugawa Japan was highly structured. The **samurai** sat at the top of society, followed by **peasants**, **artisans**, and **merchants**—the lowest class despite their wealth.

Samurai served bureaucratic roles during peacetime and were paid in **stipends of rice**. The daimyo retained local control but answered to the shogunate.

While the emperor remained a religious and cultural figurehead, real power lay with the **shogun**, whose role was to maintain order and harmony.

### V. Peace, Culture, and Urban Life

The long peace under Tokugawa rule—often called the **Pax Tokugawa**—allowed urban culture to thrive. Cities like **Edo**, **Osaka**, and **Kyoto** became bustling centers of commerce, entertainment, and art.

**Kabuki theater**, **woodblock prints (ukiyo-e)**, and the rise of **geisha culture** defined the aesthetic of the time. Education and literacy grew, and a distinct urban middle class emerged.

Despite isolation, Japan continued to absorb ideas through its limited contact with the Dutch, a form of study known as **Rangaku** (Dutch learning).

### VI. Legacy and Stability

The Tokugawa era brought unprecedented **stability**, **economic growth**, and **cultural richness** to Japan. Its strict hierarchy, internal peace, and deliberate isolation preserved Japan’s traditions—until foreign ships arrived in the 19th century demanding the nation open its doors once more.
